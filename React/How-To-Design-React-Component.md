# The react component principles


**React**: React is a data driven UI solution.

- Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
  - Rule: Find the UI boundaries, or information architecture

  - Single responsibility principle, that is, a component should idealy only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
- Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
- Use component compsition instead of inheritance or building a big component
